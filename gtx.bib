For this, we introduce a notion of metric relaxed minor and show that if G contains an $\alpha$-metric relaxed H-minor, then the distortion of any embedding of G into any metric induced by a H-minor free graph is â‰¥{\thinspace}$\alpha$. Then, for H{\thinspace} = {\thinspace}K                2,3, we present an algorithm which either finds an $\alpha$-relaxed minor, or produces an O($\alpha$)-embedding into an outerplanar metric.",
