                abstract="Interaction graphs (signed directed graphs) provide an important
                qualitative modeling approach for Systems Biology. They enable the analysis of
                causal relationships in cellular networks and can even be useful for predicting
                qualitative aspects of systems dynamics. Fundamental issues in the analysis of
                interaction graphs are the enumeration of paths and cycles (feedback loops) and the
                calculation of shortest positive/negative paths. These computational problems have
                been discussed only to a minor extent in the context of Systems Biology and in
                particular the shortest signed paths problem requires algorithmic developments.",
