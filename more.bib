                calculation of shortest positive/negative paths. These computational problems have
                been discussed only to a minor extent in the context of Systems Biology and in
                particular the shortest signed paths problem requires algorithmic developments.",

We present a generalization of the popular spectral clustering technique which integrates such constraints. Motivated by the recently proposed 1-spectral clustering for the unconstrained normalized cut problem, our method  is based on a tight relaxation of the constrained normalized cut into a continuous optimization problem.   Opposite to all other methods which have been suggested for constrained spectral clustering, we can always guarantee to satisfy all constraints. Moreover, our soft formulation allows to optimize a trade-off between normalized cut and  the number of violated constraints. An efficient implementation is provided which scales to large datasets. We outperform consistently all other proposed methods in the experiments.}

Many approximation algorithms for Correlation Clustering have been proposed with worst-case theoretical guarantees, but with less experimental evaluations. These methods simply consider the direct associations between vertices and achieve poor performance in real datasets. In this paper, we propose a neighborhood-based method called Restoring, in which we argue that the neighborhood around two connected vertices is important and two vertices belonging to the same cluster should have the same neighborhood. Our algorithm iteratively chooses two connected vertices and restores their neighborhood. We also define the cost of keeping or removing one non-common neighbor and identify a restoring order based on the neighborhood similarity. Experiments conducted on five sub datasets of Cora show that our method performs better than existing well-known methods both in results quality and objective value.",

Finding the optimal solution to the problem is proven to be NP-hard, and various algorithms have been proposed to solve the problem approximately. Unfortunately, most of them are incapable of handling large-scale data. In this paper, we relax the problem by decoupling the affinity matrix and cluster indicator matrix, and propose a pseudo-EM optimization method to improve the scalability. Experimental results on synthetic data and real world problems including image segmentation and community detection show that our technique achieves state of the art performance in terms of both accuracy and scalability.",

                abstract = "The Cluster Editing problem asks to transform a graph by at most k edge modifications into a disjoint union of cliques. The problem is NP-complete, but several parameterized algorithms are known. We present a novel search tree algorithm for the problem, which improves running time from O(1.76k+m+n) to O(1.62k+m+n) for m edges and n vertices. In detail, we can show that we can always branch with branching vector (2,1) or better, resulting in the golden ratio as the base of the search tree size. Our algorithm uses a well-known transformation to the integer-weighted counterpart of the problem. To achieve our result, we combine three techniques: First, we show that zero-edges in the graph enforce structural features that allow us to branch more efficiently. This is achieved by keeping track of the parity of merged vertices. Second, by repeatedly branching we can isolate vertices, releasing cost. Third, we use a known characterization of graphs with few conflicts. We then show that Integer-Weighted Cluster Editing remains NP-hard for graphs that have a particularly simple structure: namely, a clique minus the edges of a triangle."

                abstract  = "Constraints ubiquitously exist in many real-life applications for entity resolution (ER). However, it is always challenging to effectively specify and efficiently use constraints when performing ER tasks. In particular, not every constraint is equally effective or robust, and using weights to express the ``confidences'' on constraints becomes a natural choice. In this paper, we study entity resolution (ER) (i.e., the problem of determining which records in a database refer to the same entities) in the presence of weighted constraints. We propose a unified framework that can interweave positive and negative constraints into the ER process, and investigate how effectively and efficiently weighted constraints can be used for generating ER clustering results. Our experimental study shows that using weighted constraints can lead to improved ER quality and scalability.",
