                calculation of shortest positive/negative paths. These computational problems have
                been discussed only to a minor extent in the context of Systems Biology and in
                particular the shortest signed paths problem requires algorithmic developments.",

We present a generalization of the popular spectral clustering technique which integrates such constraints. Motivated by the recently proposed 1-spectral clustering for the unconstrained normalized cut problem, our method  is based on a tight relaxation of the constrained normalized cut into a continuous optimization problem.   Opposite to all other methods which have been suggested for constrained spectral clustering, we can always guarantee to satisfy all constraints. Moreover, our soft formulation allows to optimize a trade-off between normalized cut and  the number of violated constraints. An efficient implementation is provided which scales to large datasets. We outperform consistently all other proposed methods in the experiments.}

Many approximation algorithms for Correlation Clustering have been proposed with worst-case theoretical guarantees, but with less experimental evaluations. These methods simply consider the direct associations between vertices and achieve poor performance in real datasets. In this paper, we propose a neighborhood-based method called Restoring, in which we argue that the neighborhood around two connected vertices is important and two vertices belonging to the same cluster should have the same neighborhood. Our algorithm iteratively chooses two connected vertices and restores their neighborhood. We also define the cost of keeping or removing one non-common neighbor and identify a restoring order based on the neighborhood similarity. Experiments conducted on five sub datasets of Cora show that our method performs better than existing well-known methods both in results quality and objective value.",

Finding the optimal solution to the problem is proven to be NP-hard, and various algorithms have been proposed to solve the problem approximately. Unfortunately, most of them are incapable of handling large-scale data. In this paper, we relax the problem by decoupling the affinity matrix and cluster indicator matrix, and propose a pseudo-EM optimization method to improve the scalability. Experimental results on synthetic data and real world problems including image segmentation and community detection show that our technique achieves state of the art performance in terms of both accuracy and scalability.",
