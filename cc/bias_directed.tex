A more serious limitation is that our sign model only applies to directed graphs. Consider
another model, where each node $i$ is endowed with an integer $c_i \in \{1, \ldots, k\}$ that
specifies its cluster and let the sign of the undirected edge $i,j$ be $+$ if $c_i = c_j$ and $-$
otherwise.  This corresponds naturally to the situation modeled by the \pcc{} problem.
