% *TODO*
% give a name to Charikar2003 method, and describe where it's introduced (maybe with a picture)
% say more clearly there are 3 methods for approximation so far: LP & region growing; LP & distance
% pivot; combinatorial pivot
% say that in practice, general graphs are assumed to be complete with missing edges being negative
% move spectral clustering as a variant of CC
% - “The problem is agnostic in the sense that the clustering of the data is not taken into account
%   or even assumed to exist.” another way to look at it is that we're trying to get a binary
%   classifier of edges (+ or -) using an hypothesis class (nodes clustering) with limited
%   expression power (as it has to respect transitivity constraints, whereas signs can be inconsistent)
