# Characterizing/Analyzing edges in signed and (multi/vector)valued graphs

## 1 - Introduction

A lot of data can be described as relations between objects, either explicitly or
implicitly. The simplest and most common case is when edges are unweighted (ie
0/1) but here we consider richer information, namely edges endowed with sign
(ie -1/0/1) or a “direction” vector in $`R^d`$.

Specifically, I will show how to exploit it in three different settings:

- predict the sign of a relationship in Directed Social Networks

- predict the sign of a relationship in general graphs, by exploiting the
  connection with the Correlation Clustering (CC) problem (of which I provide a
  thorough overview)

- Explain relationships in node attributed graphs at a finer level than overall
  user profiles homophily

Still, I'm not exactly sure what would be the one sentence thesis statement I
want to defend in that work…

## 2 - Edge sign prediction in Directed Signed Social Networks

*based on the AISTATS paper*

- Give examples of such networks (+ frenemy) and motivate applications
  (recommendation, scalable detection of bullying, trolling currently being a
  huge problem in social media: [BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-37601431),
  [TIME](http://time.com/4457110/internet-trolls/), [The
  Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/07/twitter-abuse-harassment-crackdown))

- Related works, from balance theory to Leskovec and matrix factorization
  (including recent [WSDM'17
  paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3018681)), plus [the psychology part
  from Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08986) if we can make it agree with
  the regularization term

- Generative model and associated guaranteed active algorithm for dense graph

- Maximum Likelihood Approximation in batch setting and label propagation
  through a reduction from edge classification to node classification

- Online algorithm within adversarial model (I'm not well versed in Fabio's
  proof of the lower bound though)

- Real world networks experiments

- Additional experiments:

	- synthetic/real graphs with signs generated by our model so that we
	  can draw 2D histogram of MCC w.r.t $`p`$ and $`q`$ node parameters
	- when edges are sorted by creation time
	- trying to infer $`p`$ and $`q`$ directly without regularization

- A natural extension would be to handle weighted graphs, or at least clarify
	how we relate to [a ICDM'16 paper](http://cs.umd.edu/~srijan/wsn/) that
	iteratively learns two parameters per node.

## 3 - Edge sign prediction in general graphs and connection with CC

- start with some experiments showing that the previous algorithm doesn't work
  in other domains (says biology, or coreference if it's naturally directed)

A more general bias (that was originally formalized in a biology context)
assumes that nodes can be clustered such that the amount of “bad” edges
(negative edges within one cluster and positive edges across two clusters) is
minimized. Let's call this number the CC index. Equivalently, this amounts to
minimizing the number of “bad” triangles (triangle with a single negative
edge). Although this weak balance property is more intuitive in social context,
we expect such regularity to be present in other signed graphs (for instance
because of energy minimization, Ising model, and so on).

The connection between edge sign prediction and CC is well described in
[Fabio's COLT'12 paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v23/cesa-bianchi12). It
shows theoretically that the complexity of sign prediction can be quantified
through the CC index. It also provides practical algorithms that relies on
either circuit covering or low stretch trees.

I can therefore talk about **Galaxy Tree**, an easy to implement low stretch
tree, whose construction is efficient (either $`O(|E|)`$ or $`O(|E|\log |V|)`$) and
which exhibits interesting experimental results on some classes of graph,
leading us to a conjecture about its stretch.

But I can also talk about CC in general, with a survey of current approaches,
more uses of signed graphs in various fields, maybe some experimental comparisons
of the main algorithms applied to the graphs of the previous part and also the
results of two students project (on parallel CC and CC under stability
assumptions)

## 4 - Edge clustering in node attributed graphs

Again describe the setting and existing work

A nice way to link it with the previous part would be to show this somehow
generalizes the dichotomy between positive and negative edges, in the sense
that now edges can belong to one of $`k`$ class. For instance, if I have $`w_1`$
with only positive components, then an edge will have a large score
$`w_1^T(u_i\circ u_j)`$ if $`i`$ and $`j`$ agree on those dimensions. Likewise, if
$`w_2`$ has only negative components, the score is maximized if $`i`$ and $`j`$
disagree on those dimensions (ie different sign for these features), meaning
these two node profiles are dissimilar.

Then show some synthetic experiments and hopefully real ones

One real dataset we could try and that would make a link with my Aalto paper is
the following: we have geolocated venues with attributes (like user ratings,
category, hourly and weekly time profiles) from which we can build various
graphs: epsilon/knn graph based on geographic distance, similarity in user
audience, and based on our topic modelling preprocessing, i.e link them
whenever they serve the same purpose. We could run our method on such graphs
and look at the results (the last one provide a (noisy) ground truth labeling
of the edges, and the underlying topic model also offers hint on the directions
