A 2001 review on homophily, with a sociology angle, and mostly real world network, maybe get
something more recent/CS

“Homophily is the principle that a contact between similar people occurs at a higher rate than among
dissimilar people.” their conclusion is that “the literature is remarkably consistent across many
different relationships and many different dimensions of similarity: Homophily characterizes network
systems, and homogeneity characterizes personal networks.  In diverse societies, race, and race-like
ethnicity create the most stark divides. Sex, age, religion, and education also strongly structure
our relations with others.  Occupation, network position, behaviors, and intrapersonal values also
show considerable homophily, but they seem to be more specific to certain types of networks and/or
derived from the basic facts of sociodemographic homophily.” They also call for research on
multiplex: “If different types of relations are structured by different levels of homophily on
different dimensions, then multiplex relations among individuals may create systematic, important
patterns of cross-cutting social circles.”

This correlation in the class variable of connected objects can be explained by the concept of
homophily in social science [30]. Homophily suggests that a connection between similar people occurs
at a higher rate than among dissimilar ones. It is one of the first characteristics studied by early
social network researchers [2,3,50], and holds for a wide variety of relationships [30]. Homophily
is also observed in social media [10,45].

from Sanja paper:
selection Crandall et al. 2008, Feedback effects between similarity and social influence in online
communities.]): find that the homophily between two Wikipedia admin users sharply
rises some time before the tie formation and after that continues to slowly grow. This is
interpreted so that, at first, homophily plays a role in the tie formation, but after that, the tie
plays a role in the continuous increase of homophily. Research questions:
(i) Can we quantify the ways in which social influence and selection work together to affect
people’s interests and interactions?
(ii) To what extent do similarities and social interactions between people serve as predictors of
future behavior?
Another similar study on Flickr [Zeng and Wei 2013, Social ties and user content generation:
Evidence from Flickr.], finds more subtle insights: the users who have
similar popularity (defined as the average number of favorites for their photos) are more likely to
diverge in similarity after the tie formation; while the similarity continues to grow for the users
who have a larger popularity difference. This is explained by the tendency of users to stay unique
and diverse in their uploaded content from equally popular users. (talk about it in the conclusion)

adjacency matrix of FB in 2011 and show the block structure when aggregating users by country)
twitter [Sun and Rui 2017, Link Formation on Twitter: The Role of Achieved Status and Value
Homophily.] A recent study on Twitter analyzes homophily on the status (defined as the difference in
the follower counts) and the value (tweet contents, common followees, location, age etc.) levels.

we find that both more extreme and more conservative individuals tend to be more homophilous than
more liberal and more moderate ones.
